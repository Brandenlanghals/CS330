How do I approach designing software?

- First I need to gather requirements and work with stakeholders to figure out what problem we are trying to solve for our end-user. Then I would consider all its actors and the goal of the system. I find it is easier to start at the top with where the actor first exists, then mark down the end goal. After this, dig into what is required and the steps to get there, this is going to fill in the middle. If we correctly go from the user to the end result, we should have mapped out most of the product requirements and should feel confident moving forward with development.

How do I approach developing programs?

- My main goal is to create readable and maintainable code that achieves end-user requirements. Working incrementally at each aspect of the application, I can build on each component to deliver functional results. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- Computer science has already been helping me reach my goals as I currently work from home as a QA Engineer. I get to spend every day with my son and this is all thanks to changing careers into this new field. As my tool belt continues to grow within the realm of computer science I can increase my earning potential and create an even better life for my family.
